 * All of the routes in this are mounted on /api/users
 * For instance:
 *
 * router.get('/hello', () => {...})

 * would be accessible on the browser at http://localhost:3000/api/users/hello
 *
 * These route tests depend on the User Sequelize Model tests. However, it is
 * possible to pass the bulk of these tests after having properly configured
 * the User model's name and userType fields.
